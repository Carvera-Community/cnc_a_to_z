# Safety considerations

This is not a legal disclaimer, this is plain old common sense but needs to be said: using a Shapeoko comes with a small number of specific risks for your safety, that are easily adressed:

* risk of injury: these stepper motors are beefy.
  * \(obviously\) keep your hands away from the moving parts during operation, cleaning up that mess on the belts/pulleys can wait.
  * \(easy to forget\) turn off the machine before diving in to check/adjust/fix something. Yes the machine is "not supposed" to move, but user errors do happen \(ever clicked anywhere by mistake?\), software has bugs, and electronics failure are a thing. Changing en endmill while the machine is still on is probably the only sensible exception.
  * \(easy to get tired of\) wear protection goggles anytime the machine is operating, no exceptions. Endmills break from time to time, and fly out in random directions when they do. 
* fire hazard: while this risk is remote, it does exist.
  * don't leave your machine \(completely\) unattended while it is cutting. The stock material may become loose, and rubbing a piece of metal spinning at thousands of RPM against wood is a potential way to start a fire. Google "CNC" + "fire" if you need evidence.
