# Safety considerations

This is not a legal disclaimer, this is plain old common sense but needs to be said: using a CNC comes with a small number of specific risks for your safety, that are easily adressed:

* **mechanical injury**:
  * \(obviously\) keep your hands away from the moving parts during operation, cleaning up that mess on the belts/pulleys can probably wait until the end of the job.
  * Get yourself a way to do an emergency stop. A killswitch removing ALL power \(to the machine and to the router\) is easy to install, within arm's reach.
  * \(easy to forget\) turn off the machine before diving in to check/adjust/fix something. Yes the machine is "not supposed" to move by itself, but user errors happen \(ever clicked anywhere by mistake?\), and software has bugs. Changing en endmill while the machine is still powered on is probably the only sensible exception.
  * \(easy to get tired of\) wear protection goggles anytime the machine is operating without an enclosure, no exceptions. Endmills break from time to time, and may fly out in random directions when they do. 
* **respiratory hazard**: cutting some materials \(e.g. MDF\) produces dust that can be quite toxic if you inhale it, repeatedly. 
  * A good [Dust collection](dust-collection.md) system will take care of this risk. You'll find out soon enough if you don't use one \(and/or an [Enclosure](enclosures.md)\), that a thin layer of dust ends up covering everything around the machine, including the inside of your lungs.
* **fire hazard**: while this risk is very remote, it does exist.
  * don't leave your machine \(completely\) unattended while it is cutting. The stock material may become loose, and rubbing a piece of metal spinning at thousands of RPM against wood is a potential way to start a fire. Google "CNC" + "fire" if you need proof.
