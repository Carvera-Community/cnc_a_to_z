# Introduction

The intent of this guide is to help users of the Shapeoko \(or any other hobbyist CNC, really\) learn enough about both the big picture and the underlying technical concepts, to feel at ease with the machine and how it behaves. 

This is a user community initiative, not affiliated with Carbide3D company in any way, yet probably positively biased \(it's a great machine, what can we do...\) 

With so many different types of users of the Shapeoko, it is quite clear that there are many ways to learn. Some people will want to be up and running and making things as quickly as possible, without the burden of learning all the nitty gritties, and that's fine, the Shapeoko was intended to fulfill this usecase. At the other end of the spectrum, some users consider CNC and the Shapeoko as a hobby, and end-up spending more time improving the machine than actually cutting, and that's fine too. Hopefully there is a little something for everyone in this guide, but it leans towards the latter category of people.

UNDER CONTRUCTION !
