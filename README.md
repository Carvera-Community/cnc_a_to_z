# Introduction

The intent of this guide is to help users of the Shapeoko \(or any other hobbyist CNC, really\) learn enough about both the big picture and the underlying technical concepts, to feel at ease with the machine and how it behaves. 

This is a personal initiative, not affiliated with Carbide3D company in any way, yet positively biased \(it's such a great machine, what can I do...\) 

With so many different types of users of the Shapeoko, it is quite clear that there are many ways to learn. Some people will want to be up and running and making things as quickly as possible, without the burden of learning all the nitty gritties, and that's fine, the Shapeoko was intended to fulfill this usecase. At the other end of the spectrum, some users consider CNC and the Shapeoko as a hobby, and end-up spending more time improving the machine than actually cutting, and that's fine too. Hopefully there is a little something for everyone in this guide, but it leans towards the latter category of people.

As fun as it is to go ahead and cut a first project following a tutorial \(and you should\), having a good understanding of how the machine works and what underlying concepts it uses goes a long way to avoid frustration later, when things do not happen they way you expected \(and they will\).

In other words, you do not _need_ to know about many of the details presented in the following sections, but chances are it could help you down the line.
