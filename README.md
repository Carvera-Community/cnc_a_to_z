# CNC A-to-Z

The intent of this guide is to help new users of CNC machines learn enough about both the big picture and the underlying technical details, to feel at ease with the machine, the workflow, and CNC lingo in general.

This guide builds ontop of Julien Heyman's excellently written [Shapeoko CNC A to Z](https://ShapeokoEnthusiasts.gitbook.io). We have used the GitBooks varient functionality to tailor the content based on your machine type, supporting Julien's original Shapeoko content as well content for the Carvera, and other machines.

Please be aware that the intended way of reading this book is via https://cnc-a-to-z.gitbook.io/ and not GitHub.
