# CNC A-to-Z

The intent of this guide is to help new users of CNC machines learn enough about both the big picture and the underlying technical details, to feel at ease with the machine, the workflow, and CNC lingo in general.

As fun as it is to go ahead and cut a first project following a tutorial \(and you should\), having a good understanding of how the machine works and what underlying CNC concepts are involved goes a long way to avoid frustration later, when things do not work out the way you expected \(and sooner or later they will\).

There are many ways to get started. Most people want to be up and running and making things as quickly as possible, without the burden of learning all the nitty-gritties, and that's fine. At the other end of the spectrum, some users enjoy CNC and modifying their machine as a hobby, and end up spending more time experimenting than actually cutting useful projects, and that's fine too. Hopefully there is a little something for everyone in this guide.

This guide builds ontop of Julien Heyman's excellently written [Shapeoko CNC A to Z](https://ShapeokoEnthusiasts.gitbook.io). We have used the GitBooks varient functionality to allow you to select which family of CNC machines you are using in order to tailor the content based on your machine type.
