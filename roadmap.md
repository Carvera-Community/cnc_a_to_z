# Roadmap

There are many ways to learn and use the Shapeoko, but the typical experience goes something like this:

* Purchase the machine \(after reading a lot of good things about it\) 
* While waiting for delivery, get familiar with CNC concepts 
  * This is the intent of the first sections \([Workflow](workflow.md), [Coordinate system](coordinate-system.md), [Anatomy of a Shapeoko](anatomy-of-a-shapeoko.md), [CAD, CAM, G-code](cad-cam-tools.md), [Cutters & collets](cutters.md), [Feeds & speeds](feeds-and-speeds-basics.md), [Toolpaths](toolpath-basics.md), [Workholding](workholding.md)\). They go in way more detail than is strictly necessary to get started, so if it feels overwhelming just skip the details.
  * The [Cutters & collets](cutters.md) section includes a few indications as to what starter set of endmills and collets could be suitable for you, depending on the projects you have in mind. 
* Receive and assemble the machine, and run the first Hello World. Oh the joy of these first few hours! I chose _not_ to have a section about machine assembly, because Carbide3D's docs are quite detailed already \(still, take them with a grain of salt, they are not 100% foolproof & unambiguous\), and there are many things that are either specific to the machine type \(standard vs XL vs XXL\) or bound to change frequently and render this information obsolete. Carbide3D's support email and community forum are the best way to sort out any specific machine assembly.
* To run your first cuts in wood or MDF, learn about [Homing, Zeroing, Cutting](first-cuts.md), then anxiously click on the "run" button for the first time. 
* Realize that:
  * CNC is messy, and now is a good time to look into [Dust collection, Enclosures](dust-collection.md)
  * The geometry of cut pieces or finish quality is not quite right, and that it may be necessary to look into [Squaring, surfacing, tramming](squaring.md), and possibly [Dimensional accuracy](x-y-z-calibration.md).
* Try cutting plastics or metal \([Usecases: cutting plastics](cutting-plastics.md) , [Usecases: cutting metal](cutting-metal.md)\)
* At some point, witness the machine misbehave, blame the hardware or the software, start [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md), and \(often\) end up concluding that you messed up somewhere in the workflow.
* Somewhere along the path, outgrow Carbide Create and Carbide Motion and consider moving to more advanced [CAD, CAM, G-code](cad-cam-tools.md) sender tools.
* Perform a little [Maintenance](maintenance.md) from time to time, to keep the machine in optimal working conditions.
* After a while, begin to feel an itch for [Upgrading the machine](upgrading-the-machine.md)
