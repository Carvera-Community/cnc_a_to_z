# Roadmap

There are many ways to learn and use the Shapeoko, but the typical experience goes something like this:

* Purchasing the machine \(after reading a lot of good things about it\) 
* While waiting for delivery, getting familiar with CNC concepts 
  * This is the intent of the first sections \([Workflow](workflow.md), [Coordinate system](coordinate-system.md), [Anatomy of a Shapeoko](anatomy-of-a-shapeoko.md), [G-code primer](), [Cutters](cutters.md), [Collets](), [Feeds & speeds](feeds-and-speeds-basics.md), [Toolpaths basics](toolpath-basics.md), [Workholding](workholding.md)\). They go in way more detail than is strictly necessary to get started, so if it feels overwhelming \(I know it did for me\) just skip details for later.
  * The [Cutters](cutters.md) section includes a few indications as to what starter set of endmills could be suitable for you, depending on the projects you have in mind. 
* Receiving and assembling the machine, and run the first Hello World. Oh the joy of these first few hours! I chose _not_ to have a section about machine assembly, because Carbide3D's docs are quite detailed already \(still, take them with a grain of salt, they are not 100% foolproof & unambiguous\), and they are many things that are either specific to the machine type \(standard, XL, XXL\). The Shapeoko support email and forum are the best way to sort out any specific machine assembly
* Running your first cuts in wood or MDF, learn about [Homing, Zeroing, Cutting](first-cuts.md), then anxiously click on the "run" button for the first time. 
* Realizing that:
  * CNC is messy, and now is a good time for installing a [Dust collection](dust-collection.md) system, and maybe build an [Enclosure]()
  * The geometry of cut pieces or finish quaity is not quite right, and it may be necessary to look into [Squaring](squaring.md), [Tramming and surfacing](), [Dimensional accuracy](x-y-z-calibration.md), or [Managing runout]()
* Trying [Cutting plastics](cutting-plastics.md) or [Cutting metal](cutting-metal.md)
* At some point, witnessing the machine misbehave, blame the hardware or the software, do some [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md), and \(very often\) end up concluding that you messed up somewhere.
* Somewhere along the path, outgrowing Carbide Create and Carbide Motion and consider [Upgrading to advanced software]()
* Realizing that a little [Maintenance](maintenance.md) is required from time to time, to get the machine in optimal working conditions.
* After a while, beginning to feel an itch for [Upgrading the machine](upgrading-the-machine.md)
