# Replacing endmills

As much as we would like our \(somewhat expensive\) endmills to last forever, the cold hard truth is that they are consumables, and need to be replaced from time to time. How long they last is subject to many variables, so it's quite difficult to give a general rule.

One important thing to maximize tool life is to use appropriate [Feeds & speeds](../cnc-concepts-1/feeds-and-speeds-basics.md). Yet sooner or later, the flutes will go dull.

The tricky part is that a somewhat blunt endmill will still work, sort of. It might even be good enough to do quick & dirty cuts. But telltale signs of a worn out endmill are:

* bad finish quality
* endmill getting hot after a cut \(assuming proper feeds and speeds were  used\), which is a sign that it is rubbing as much as it is cutting through the material.
* chatter/unpleasant noise even at adequate feeds & speeds.

For illustration, here's a close-up view of oak chips made using a worn-out endmill:

And here a view of the chips with a brand new endmill for the same cut:
