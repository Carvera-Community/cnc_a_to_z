# Cutters

It's easy to be overwhelmed at first by the variety of tools and their characteristics, it’s a whole world in itself. Roughly, an endmill is caracterized by:

* its **type**:
  * **square**: the most common type, a straight endmill with square end, used to machine flat pockets/recesses
    * up spiral: the direction of the flute is such that it pulls chips away from the cutting surface, thus is quite efficient at removing chips, but could produce tear out on the material surface.
    * down spiral: pushes chips downward when cutting, so not efficient to remove them from the cutting area, but can reduce tear out on the material, for a better finish.
  * **ballnose**: it has a round tip, which helps getting a better finish on 3D-machined parts \(i.e. produces less visible steps\)
  * **V-bit** of a given angle: specialized bit typically used for carving text.
  * **surfacing** bit, specialized to make a shallow cut over a large diameter.
* other **specialized** types \(engraving bit with a very pointy end, surfacing bit which is a square bit with a very large diameter\)
* whether it is **center cutting** or not. Most are, it means it has the ability to plunge into the material \(vertically\), like a drill bit does.
* the **diameter of its shank** \(the part that goes in the collet\)
* the **diameter of its cutting part**
* the **length of its cutting part \(**Length of cut - LOC**\)**, and its overall length \(OAL\).
* the **number of flutes** = number of cutting teeth
* the **material it is made of**, and its **coating** if any

The most common endmills for the Shapeoko have a diameter of 1/4” \(6.35mm\), 1/8” \(3.175mm\), and 1/16" \(1.5875mm\), with some additional metric sizes \(4, 6 and 8mm\)
