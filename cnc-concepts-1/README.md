# CNC concepts

As fun as it is to go ahead and cut a first project following a tutorial \(and you should\), having a good understanding of how the machine works and what underlying concepts it uses goes a long way to avoid frustration later, when things do not happen they way you expected \(and they will\).

In other words, you do not _need_ to know about all the details presented in this section, but chances are it could help down the line.
